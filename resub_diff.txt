< Methods such as bi-parental QTL mapping and genome-wide association studies (GWAS) each have their own advantages and limitations.
< Multi-parent advanced generation inter-crossing (MAGIC) populations contain more recombination events and genetic diversity than bi-parental mapping populations and are better able to estimate effect sizes of rare alleles than association mapping populations.
< Here we discuss the results of using a MAGIC population of doubled haploid (DH) maize lines created from 16 diverse founders to perform QTL mapping.
< We compare three models that assume bi-allelic, founder, and ancestral haplotype allelic states for QTL.
< The three methods have differing power to detect QTL for a variety of agronomic traits.
< Although the founder approach finds the most QTL, all methods are able to find unique  QTL, suggesting that each model has advantages for traits with different  genetic architectures.
< A closer look at a well-characterized flowering time QTL, qDTA8, which contains \emph{vgt1}, highlights the strengths and weaknesses of each method and suggests a potential epistatic interaction.

< In particular, different types of populations tend to vary in two main characteristics: (1) their ability to capture genetic diversity and (2) their power to detect QTL of small effect.
< Multi-parent Advanced Generation Intercross (MAGIC) populations have been used in breeding to increase the genetic diversity included in a mapping population compared to biparental populations in multiple model organisms. In plants, MAGIC populations have been created for maize \citep{DellAcqua}, wheat \citep{Huang}, tomato \citep{Pascual}, and Arabidopsis \citep{Kover,Huang4}, among others. For animal models, populations such as the Collaborative Cross in mice \citep{Churchill,Aylor} and the \emph{Drosophila} Synthetic Population Resource (DSPR) \citep{King} have likewise been created.

< In this study, we used a MAGIC population of 344 doubled-haploid lines derived from 16 inbred maize parents developed by the company Biogemma to understand how genetic models can impact the identification of QTL.
< Compared to previous populations in maize, this MAGIC population has a greater number of founders, and should have comparable power to larger nested mapping  populations \citep{DellAcqua,Yu2}. In addition, using doubled haploids (DHs) instead of recombinant inbred lines (RILs) removes any residual heterozygosity, ensuring that replicates are genetically identical.
< For these reasons, the Biogemma MAGIC population that we present here has great potential to reveal new insights into the genetic control of quantitative traits in maize.

< The number of lines that had a probability of a particular founder greater than 0.8 were used as  an approximation of the number of lines that had that founder at a site.
< This observed count was compared to a null expectation of $1/16$ for equal distribution across lines (approximately 21 lines per founder)(Figure \ref{fig:figure1}B \& C).
< We performed a $\rchi^2$ test for each site to determine if founder counts significantly deviated from null expectation.
< We obtained a 5\% significance threshold using the $\rchi^2$ obtained from founder counts in 100 simulated populations.
< The $\rchi^2$ tests from simulated lines were done using reconstructed genotype data pulled from the 600K genotype data of the 16 founders.
< We then used the same methods of calculating founder probabilities with R/qtl2 used with the actual population.
< Due to the fact that we used the inferred founder identities of the simulated lines, rather than the known founder identities, the null distribution of p-values generated from $\rchi^2$ tests of the simulated populations incorporated uncertainty of founder assignment.

< \subsection{Founder Representation and Linkage Disequilibrium}
< 
< Analysis of the MAGIC population showed that the overall representation of the 16 founders in the MAGIC DH lines was relatively even, with the highest percentage founder, A654, representing 6.7\% and the lowest percentage founder, EP1, representing 5.2\%, compared to the expectation of 6.25\% for each founder (Figure \ref{fig:figure1}B).
< However, multiple chromosome regions deviated significantly from the expected equal distribution (Figure \ref{fig:figure1}A).
< Across individual regions of each chromosome, 20.4\% of the genome significantly deviated from null expectations compared to 100 simulated populations (5\% significance threshold $\rchi^2$ test p-value < 1.5e-09) (Figure \ref{fig:supfigure11}).
< The fact that the $\rchi^2$ test performed on 100 simulated MAGIC populations of 344 individuals resulted in far fewer significant $\rchi^2$ peaks shows that the over- and under-representation of certain founder alleles was greater than would be expected by chance.
< It also shows that over- and under-representation of founder alleles in the population was not due to potential inaccuracy of R/qtl2 in assigning founders.
< These results suggests that a large amount of the over- and under-representation of founder alleles in the MAGIC population is biological, rather than a result of model error, and perhaps evidence of selection for or against particular founder alleles.
< 
< We estimated recombination rates and linkage disequilibrium across the MAGIC lines.
< The intra-chromosomal LD structure shows fast LD decay consistent with many recombination events (Figure \ref{fig:supfigure10}).
< Unexpectedly, there was a large amount of high inter-chromosomal LD (Figure \ref{fig:circosfigure}A).
< Of a total of 9,796,630 SNP pairs with an $R^2$ greater than or equal to 0.9, 426,178 (4.3\%) of those pairs came from different chromosomes.
< The number of inter-chromosomal high LD regions was more than would be expected by chance:
< in 100 simulated populations, there were no SNP pairs with $R^2$ greater than 0.9 detected between chromosomes.
< We detected large segments of inter-chromosomal LD between chromosome 3 and chromosome 8, but these regions did not overlap with the support intervals for \emph{qDTA8} and \emph{qDTA3-2}, corresponding to \emph{vgt1} and \emph{vgt3}, respectively (Figure \ref{fig:circosfigure}A).
< 
< Because individual DH lines were required to overlap in flowering time with the tester, MBS847, in order to successfully make F1s for the MAGIC population (Figure \ref{fig:figure1a}) , we hypothesized that the patterns observed in founder representation and linkage disequilibrium might be due to selection on flowering time.
< In particular, the tester, MBS847, is a generally later flowering line and is $MITE^-$ at \emph{vgt1} \citep{Chardon}, providing the opportunity for selection against early flowering alleles.
< As one test of this hypothesis, we asked whether genes involved in flowering were enriched in regions with high inter-chromosomal LD, and found strong enrichment of flowering time genes  in those regions compared to 1,000 randomized permutations (p-value<0.001)(\ref{fig:circosfigure}B).
< We found no significant enrichment of flowering time genes within regions with significantly uneven founder representation (Figure \ref{fig:supfigure4}).
< The finding that regions with high LD between chromosomes contain more flowering time genes than would be expected by chance suggests that selection for the combination of particular alleles affecting flowering may have occurred.

> 
> The MAGIC population showed an overall balance of coverage from the 16 founders (Figure \ref{fig:figure1}C).
> Analysis of the MAGIC population showed that the overall representation of the 16 founders in the MAGIC DH lines was relatively even, with the highest percentage founder, A654, representing 6.741\% and the lowest percentage founder, EP1, representing 5.237\%.
> However, multiple chromosome regions deviated significantly from the expected equal distribution (Figure \ref{fig:figure1}B).
> Across individual regions of each chromosomes, 20.4\% of the genome significantly deviated from null expectations compared to 100 simulated populations (5\% significance threshold $\rchi^2$ test p-value < 1.485e-09) (Figure \ref{fig:supfigure11}).
> % Why not using a bootstrap approach instead? You could also have used R/qtl2 on your simulated data to generate a baseline including the uncertainty of the haplotype calling step and at the same time validate with your simulated data the quality of the assignment quality (this would be helpful for the discussion and interpretation of the GWAS results)
> The fact that the $\rchi^2$ test performed on 100 simulated MAGIC populations of 325 individuals resulted in far fewer significant $\rchi^2$ peaks showed that the over- and under-representation of certain founder alleles was greater than would be expected by chance.
> %($\mu=$0.16\%, $\sigma=$0.23\%,median=0.082\%),
> %Make this clearer (elaborate that simulations take into account errors from R/qtl2 - rather than using a Bonferroni p-value, use a 5% p-value from the simulations
> It also shows that over- and under-representation of founder alleles in the population was not due inaccuracy of R/qtl2 in assigning founders.
> 
> %In order to ensure that these chi-squared peaks were not a result of technical error, we performed the same chi-squared test using haplotypes rather than founders.
> %Using haplotype probabilities, 17.7\% of sites deviated from null expectations (Supplemental Figure).
> These results suggests that a large amount of the over- and under-representation of founder alleles in the MAGIC population is biological, rather than a result of model error, and perhaps evidence of selection for or against particular founder alleles.
> 
> We estimated recombination rates and linkage disequilibrium across the MAGIC lines.
> %The founder probabilities showed levels of recombination in the MAGIC population that are consistent with expectations from the simulated MAGIC populations.
> The intra-chromosomal LD structure show fast LD decay consistent with many recombination events (Figure \ref{fig:supfigure10}).

> Of a total of 9,796,630 SNP pairs with an $R^2$ greater than or equal to 0.9, 365,345 (3.7\%) of those pairs came from different chromosomes.
> The number of inter-chromosomal high LD regions were more than would be expected by chance. In 100 simulated populations, there were no SNP pairs with $R^2$ greater than 0.9 detected between chromosomes.
> Interestingly, a large segment of interchromosomal-LD between chromosome 3 and chromosome 8 (Figure \ref{fig:circosfigure}) overlaps with the support intervals for \emph{qDTA8} and \emph{qDTA3-2}, corresponding to \emph{vgt1} and \emph{vgt3}, respectively.

> % Selection on flowering time
> \subsection{Evidence of Selecion on Flowering Time}
> We had reason to believe that selection on flowering time occurred during the making of the MAGIC population.
> When MAGIC DH lines were crossed to the inbred tester to produce MAGIC F1s, the DH lines needed to nick with the tester in order for crosses to be made.
> The tester, MBS847, is a generally later flowering line and is $MITE^-$ at \emph{vgt1} \cite{Chardon}.
> For this reason, we would expect that, if selection on flowering time had occurred, most of the genetic variation that was selected against would have been for earlier flowering alleles.
> We tested to see if genes involved in flowering were enriched in $\rchi^2$ peaks, where some founderss and haplotypes were significantly over- or under-represented.
> However, the number of FT genes found within $\rchi^2$ peaks was not significantly different than were expected by chance (Figure \ref{fig:supfigure4}).
> %Presence/absence of FT genes
> Therefore, there is no evidence that the over- and under-representation of particular founders and haplotypes was due to the presence of flowering time genes within these regions.
> 
> %Due to the fact that MBS847 is earlier flowering, we would expect that earlier flowering alleles would be selected against and be at a lower frequency in the resulting MAGIC F1s.
> %We suspected that this would result in the flowering time polygenic scores (PGS) of the actual population to be later than those from random simulations.
> %However, the mean polygenic score (PGS) for DTA for the actual lines ($\mu$=-1.127) was earlier than the average from the 100 simulated MAGIC populations, though it was still within the 95\% confidence interval of the simulated distribution.
> %Interestingly, the variance of the distribution of polygenic scores was significantly higher in the actual population than any of the simulated populations.
> %These results suggest that there was little to no polygenic selection for earlier days to anthesis during the making of the population.

< The population displayed unexpected patterns of uneven founder representation along the genome (Figure \ref{fig:figure1}C).
< The apparent high over- or under-representation of some founder alleles may be due to these founders being in close IBD with another founder, resulting in uncertainty in the founder probabilities.
< Nonetheless, the high accuracy of founder assignment and low number of sites that significantly deviate from equal founder distribution in our simulations make this explanation seem unlikely.

< Another interesting observation of the population was the relatively high levels of inter-chromosomal LD (Figure \ref{fig:circosfigure}), which deviated significantly from that obtained from simulations.
< A potential consequence of inter-chromosomal LD is the chance for confounding of association analyses, namely resulting in the detection of "ghost" QTL.
< Although for the discussed QTL detected that were in high inter-chromosomal LD with one another, \emph{qDTA8} and \emph{qDTA3-2}, their effects on flowering time were independent, the chance for false positives and inaccurate support intervals due to LD structure is still worth noting.

< Both of these observations suggest that forces other than those of random segregation have operated on the MAGIC population, further supported by the fact that genes affecting flowering time were strongly enriched in regions of high inter-chromosomal LD (Figure \ref{fig:circosfigure}).
< These observations raise the possibility that the complex crossing schemes of MAGIC populations have the potential to introduce the influence of selection, which may restrict the very genetic variation that we are attempting to study.

> As a multi-parent population, it has the advantages of increased diversity compared to bi-parental mapping populations, no population structure , and higher power to detect QTL with lower allele frequencies.
516,517c673,675
< The benefits of increasing statistical power by reducing model parameters in bi-allelic and ancestral haplotype models seem to be tempered by the true allelic complexity of the multi-parent population being studied.
< We conclude that if the goal of a study is to find as many QTL as possible, then it would be most useful to consider the genetic diversity contained within the population when choosing a model in order to maximize QTL identification.
